I have used this dataset for my tasks completion.
# Overview

The objective involves analyzing a given video by detecting faces, employing OCR to recognize text, and generating descriptive captions for each frame, ultimately weaving together a coherent narrative that provides insights into the video content, such as identifying the most frequent face and pinpointing timestamps for specific text instances.

# Dependencies
To successfully execute the video analysis, ensure you have the following dependencies:

Python 3.x: This analysis is implemented in Python programming language. Python 3.x is recommended for compatibility.
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library): OpenCV is a powerful open-source library used for computer vision tasks, including face detection.
Tesseract: Tesseract is an open-source OCR engine maintained by Google. It's used for text recognition in images and videos.
Pytesseract: Pytesseract is a Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR engine. It allows easy integration of Tesseract into Python applications.
Additional Libraries: Depending on your specific requirements and analysis, you might need additional Python libraries for image processing, data manipulation, and text analysis. 
Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and accessible in your Python environment before running the video analysis script.
